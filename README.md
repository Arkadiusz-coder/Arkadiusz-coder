Hello! My name is Arkadiusz Deka, I am learning frontend technologies. 

Currently I developing my knowledge about CSS and JS to get solid, more than basic, skills. In next few months I'm going to learn React library.After that I want to get skill in Tailwind framework.  

I am following a roadmap.sh for Frontend, thanks to which my learning is more sistemative than it use to be. I'm leveling up my leyaout skills with corses of Kevin Powell. Currently, most of the time, I spend on Frontend Mentor projects. I think experiance gained this way is the most valueble. 

Iâ€™m interested in creating users friendly and high quality web pages. My ambition is to become independent fullstack developer.

I would be happy to collaborate with someone in projects that would help me grow as a programmer.
