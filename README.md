Hello! My name is Arkadiusz Deka, I am learning frontend technologies. 

Currently I developing my knowledge about CSS and JS to get solid, more than basic, skills. In next few months I'm going to learn React library.

Iâ€™m interested in creating users friendly and high quality web pages. My ambition is to become independent fullstack developer.

I would be happy to collaborate with someone in projects that would help me grow as a programmer.
