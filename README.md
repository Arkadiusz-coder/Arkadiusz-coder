Hello! My name is Arkadiusz Deka. I want to become Full Stack Developer. 

Currently I developing my knowledge about CSS and JS to get solid, more than basic, skills. In next few months I'm going to learn React library. After that I want to get skill in Tailwind framework.  

I am following a roadmap.sh for Frontend.

Currently, most of the time, I spend on Frontend Mentor projects.

Iâ€™m interested in creating users friendly and high quality web pages.

I would be happy to collaborate with someone in projects that would help me grow as a programmer.
